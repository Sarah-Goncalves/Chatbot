# Chatbot

This repository provides a simple dataset (.csv) with few questions and answers in french, 
and a jupiter notebook where you'll find some preprocessing like regex, to clean the data. Then you'll see how to use numpy 
and the scikit-learn library from Python to calculate the distance between the new question asked to the Chatbot and the questions it 
already knows the answers to, to be able to select the right answer to respond to the user.    

This is a very basic chatbot to begin with, enjoy !
